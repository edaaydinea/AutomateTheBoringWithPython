    "1. **What is the Unix epoch?**  \n",
    "   The Unix epoch is the starting point used by Unix systems for time representation, which is **January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 UTC**. It is the moment from which time is counted in seconds for Unix-based systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What function returns the number of seconds since the Unix epoch?**  \n",
    "   The function `time.time()` in the `time` module returns the number of seconds since the Unix epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How can you pause your program for exactly 5 seconds?**  \n",
    "   You can use the `time.sleep(5)` function to pause the program for 5 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What does the `round()` function return?**  \n",
    "   The `round()` function returns a number rounded to a specified number of decimal places. If no decimal places are specified, it rounds to the nearest integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What is the difference between a `datetime` object and a `timedelta` object?**  \n",
    "   - A `datetime` object represents a **specific date and time**, including year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond.\n",
    "   - A `timedelta` object represents a **duration of time** or a difference between two dates/times (e.g., 5 days, 3 hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Using the `datetime` module, what day of the week was January 7, 2019?**  \n",
    "   You can determine the day of the week with the following code:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import datetime\n",
    "   date = datetime.datetime(2019, 1, 7)\n",
    "   print(date.strftime(\"%A\"))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Output: `Monday`\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Say you have a function named `spam()`. How can you call this function and run the code inside it in a separate thread?**  \n",
    "   You can use the `threading` module to run `spam()` in a separate thread:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "   thread = threading.Thread(target=spam)\n",
    "   thread.start()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **What should you do to avoid concurrency issues with multiple threads?**  \n",
    "   To avoid concurrency issues (like race conditions), you should use **thread synchronization mechanisms** such as **locks (e.g., `threading.Lock`)**, **semaphores**, or **queues** to manage access to shared resources."
