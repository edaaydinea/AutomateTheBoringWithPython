    "   - `webbrowser`: Opens a browser and allows you to programmatically control it, e.g., opening a URL.\n",
    "   - `requests`: A module for sending HTTP requests and handling responses (e.g., downloading web content).\n",
    "   - `bs4` (BeautifulSoup): A library for parsing HTML and XML documents, useful for web scraping.\n",
    "   - `selenium`: Automates browser interaction by controlling a browser instance through a script (e.g., clicking buttons, filling forms).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What type of object is returned by `requests.get()`?**  \n",
    "   - A `Response` object.\n",
    "   - To access the content as a string: `response.text`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What requests method checks that the download worked?**  \n",
    "   - The `response.raise_for_status()` method will raise an exception if the download was unsuccessful.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How can you get the HTTP status code of a `requests` response?**  \n",
    "   - By accessing the `.status_code` attribute of the `Response` object (e.g., `response.status_code`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **How do you save a `requests` response to a file?**  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('file_name', 'wb') as file:\n",
    "       file.write(response.content)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What is the keyboard shortcut for opening a browser’s developer tools?**  \n",
    "   - `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Opt+I` (Mac).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **How can you view (in the developer tools) the HTML of a specific element on a web page?**  \n",
    "   - Right-click the element and choose \"Inspect\" or use the \"Elements\" tab to browse the DOM tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **What is the CSS selector string that would find the element with an `id` attribute of `main`?**  \n",
    "   - `'#main'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What is the CSS selector string that would find the elements with a CSS class of `highlight`?**  \n",
    "   - `'.highlight'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **What is the CSS selector string that would find all the `<div>` elements inside another `<div>` element?**  \n",
    "   - `'div div'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **What is the CSS selector string that would find the `<button>` element with a `value` attribute set to `favorite`?**  \n",
    "   - `'button[value=\"favorite\"]'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **How could you get the string `'Hello, world!'` from the BeautifulSoup Tag object `<div>Hello, world!</div>` stored in the variable `spam`?**  \n",
    "   - `spam.get_text()` or `spam.text`.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **How would you store all the attributes of a BeautifulSoup Tag object in a variable named `linkElem`?**  \n",
    "   - `linkElem.attrs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **How do you properly import the selenium module?**  \n",
    "   - `from selenium import webdriver`.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **What’s the difference between the `find_element_*` and `find_elements_*` methods?**  \n",

    "   - `.click()` for simulating mouse clicks.\n",
    "   - `.send_keys()` for simulating keyboard input.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **An easier way to submit a form with selenium instead of calling `send_keys(Keys.ENTER)` on the Submit button’s WebElement object:**  \n",
    "   - Use `.submit()` on the form’s WebElement.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **How can you simulate clicking a browser’s Forward, Back, and Refresh buttons with selenium?**  \n",
    "   - `.forward()` to simulate the Forward button.\n",
