# The code will keep asking the user to type their name until the user types "your name". Once the user types "your name", the program will print "Thank you!" and then end. The condition of the while loop is True, so the loop will continue to execute indefinitely. The input() function call lets the user type in a string, which is stored in the name variable. The print() function call displays the string "Please type your name." to the user. The break statement will exit the loop when the user types "your name".
