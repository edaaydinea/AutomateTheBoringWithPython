    "1. **Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?**\n",
    "   - Functions help make your code more modular and reusable. They allow you to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks. Functions also help reduce repetition and make code easier to understand, maintain, and test.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **When does the code in a function execute: when the function is defined or when the function is called?**\n",
    "   - The code in a function executes when the function is called, not when it is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What statement creates a function?**\n",
    "   - The `def` statement creates a function. For example:  \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def my_function():\n",
    "         # Function body\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What is the difference between a function and a function call?**\n",
    "   - A function defines a block of code that can be executed later. A function call executes the code inside the function.  \n",
    "     Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def greet():  # Function definition\n",
    "         print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "     greet()  # Function call, this prints \"Hello!\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?**\n",
    "   - There is only **one global scope** in a Python program. However, **local scopes** are created each time a function is called, and they are discarded after the function completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?**\n",
    "   - Variables in a local scope are destroyed when the function call returns. The local scope ceases to exist, and its variables are deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What is a return value? Can a return value be part of an expression?**\n",
    "   - A return value is the value that a function sends back to the caller using the `return` statement. Yes, a return value can be part of an expression. For example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def add(a, b):\n",
    "         return a + b\n",
    "     result = add(2, 3) * 5  # The return value (5) is part of the expression\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?**\n",
    "   - If a function does not have a return statement, it returns `None` by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **How can you force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable?**\n",
    "   - You can use the `global` keyword inside a function to modify a global variable.  \n",
    "     Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     x = 10\n",
    "     def modify_global():\n",
    "         global x\n",
    "         x = 20\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **What is the data type of `None`?**\n",
    "    - The data type of `None` is `NoneType`.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **What does the `import areallyourpetsnamederic` statement do?**\n",
    "    - This statement tries to import a module named `areallyourpetsnamederic`. If the module doesn't exist, it raises an `ImportError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **If you had a function named `bacon()` in a module named `spam`, how would you call it after importing `spam`?**\n",
    "    - You would call it like this:  \n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      import spam\n",
    "      spam.bacon()\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **How can you prevent a program from crashing when it gets an error?**\n",
    "    - You can use `try` and `except` blocks to handle errors and prevent a program from crashing when an exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **What goes in the `try` clause? What goes in the `except` clause?**\n",
    "    - The `try` clause contains the code that might raise an exception, and the `except` clause contains the code that runs if an exception occurs. Example:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      try:\n",
    "          # Code that may raise an error\n",
    "          result = 10 / 0\n",
    "      except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "          # Code to handle the error\n",
    "          print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "      ```"
