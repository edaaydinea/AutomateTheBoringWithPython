    "1. **What does the `openpyxl.load_workbook()` function return?**\n",
    "   - It returns a `Workbook` object representing the loaded Excel file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What does the `wb.sheetnames` workbook attribute contain?**\n",
    "   - It contains a list of the names of all the sheets in the workbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How would you retrieve the `Worksheet` object for a sheet named 'Sheet1'?**\n",
    "   - You would use `wb['Sheet1']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How would you retrieve the `Worksheet` object for the workbook’s active sheet?**\n",
    "   - You would use `wb.active`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **How would you retrieve the value in the cell C5?**\n",
    "   - You would use `sheet['C5'].value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **How would you set the value in the cell C5 to \"Hello\"?**\n",
    "   - You would use `sheet['C5'] = \"Hello\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **How would you retrieve the cell’s row and column as integers?**\n",
    "   - You would use `cell.row` and `cell.column`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **What do the `sheet.max_column` and `sheet.max_row` sheet attributes hold, and what is the data type of these attributes?**\n",
    "   - `sheet.max_column` holds the highest column index with data, and `sheet.max_row` holds the highest row index with data. Both attributes are integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **If you needed to get the integer index for column 'M', what function would you need to call?**\n",
    "   - You would use `openpyxl.utils.column_index_from_string('M')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **If you needed to get the string name for column 14, what function would you need to call?**\n",
    "    - You would use `openpyxl.utils.get_column_letter(14)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **How can you retrieve a tuple of all the Cell objects from A1 to F1?**\n",
    "    - You would use `sheet['A1:F1']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **How would you save the workbook to the filename `example.xlsx`?**\n",
    "    - You would use `wb.save('example.xlsx')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **How do you set a formula in a cell?**\n",
    "    - You would set the cell's value to the formula string, e.g., `sheet['A1'] = '=SUM(B1:B10)'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **If you want to retrieve the result of a cell’s formula instead of the cell’s formula itself, what must you do first?**\n",
    "    - You need to open the workbook with the `data_only=True` argument in `load_workbook()`, like `wb = openpyxl.load_workbook('example.xlsx', data_only=True)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **How would you set the height of row 5 to 100?**\n",
    "    - You would use `sheet.row_dimensions[5].height = 100`.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **How would you hide column C?**\n",
    "    - You would use `sheet.column_dimensions['C'].hidden = True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **What is a freeze pane?**\n",
    "    - A freeze pane locks rows or columns in place so that they remain visible when you scroll through the worksheet. For example, freezing the top row ensures it stays visible while scrolling down.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **What five functions and methods do you have to call to create a bar chart?**\n",
    "    1. Define the chart type (e.g., `BarChart()`).\n",
    "    2. Add data to the chart (`chart.add_data()`).\n",
    "    3. Optionally set categories for the chart (`chart.set_categories()`).\n",
    "    4. Place the chart in the worksheet (`sheet.add_chart()`).\n",
    "    5. Save the workbook (`wb.save()`)."
