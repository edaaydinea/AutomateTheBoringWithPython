    "1. **What is the function that creates Regex objects?**\n",
    "   - The function that creates Regex objects is `re.compile()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why are raw strings often used when creating Regex objects?**\n",
    "   - Raw strings (denoted by `r''`) are used to avoid having to escape backslashes, which are common in regex patterns. This makes the pattern easier to read and reduces the chance of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What does the search() method return?**\n",
    "   - The `search()` method returns a Match object if the pattern is found in the string; otherwise, it returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How do you get the actual strings that match the pattern from a Match object?**\n",
    "   - You can use the `group()` method on the Match object. `group(0)` returns the entire match, while `group(1)`, `group(2)`, etc., return the specific groups defined by parentheses in the regex pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **In the regex created from r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group 0 cover? Group 1? Group 2?**\n",
    "   - Group 0 covers the entire match (e.g., `123-456-7890`), group 1 covers the first capturing group (e.g., `123`), and group 2 covers the second capturing group (e.g., `456-7890`).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Parentheses and periods have specific meanings in regular expression syntax. How would you specify that you want a regex to match actual parentheses and period characters?**\n",
    "   - You would escape them using a backslash: `\\(`, `\\)`, and `\\.`. For example, the regex to match a literal set of parentheses would be `\\(\\)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **The findall() method returns a list of strings or a list of tuples of strings. What makes it return one or the other?**\n",
    "   - `findall()` returns a list of strings if there are no capturing groups in the regex. If there are capturing groups, it returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the matched groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **What does the | character signify in regular expressions?**\n",
    "   - The `|` character signifies logical OR, allowing for alternative matches. For example, `cat|dog` matches either \"cat\" or \"dog\".\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What two things does the ? character signify in regular expressions?**\n",
    "   - The `?` character signifies that the preceding element is optional (i.e., it can occur zero or one time) and can also indicate non-greedy matching when used in patterns like `.*?`.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **What is the difference between the + and * characters in regular expressions?**\n",
    "    - The `+` character signifies that the preceding element must occur one or more times, while the `*` character signifies that it can occur zero or more times.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **What is the difference between {3} and {3,5} in regular expressions?**\n",
    "    - `{3}` specifies that the preceding element must occur exactly three times, while `{3,5}` specifies that it can occur between three and five times (inclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **What do the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?**\n",
    "    - `\\d` matches any digit (equivalent to `[0-9]`), `\\w` matches any alphanumeric character (equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`), and `\\s` matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, newlines).\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **What do the \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?**\n",
    "    - `\\D` matches any non-digit character, `\\W` matches any non-alphanumeric character, and `\\S` matches any non-whitespace character.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **What is the difference between .* and .*??**\n",
    "    - `.*` matches as many characters as possible (greedy matching), while `.*?` matches as few characters as possible (non-greedy matching).\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **What is the character class syntax to match all numbers and lowercase letters?**\n",
    "    - The character class syntax to match all numbers and lowercase letters is `[0-9a-z]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **How do you make a regular expression case-insensitive?**\n",
    "    - You can make a regex case-insensitive by using the `re.IGNORECASE` flag as the second argument to `re.compile()` or by adding `(?i)` at the start of the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile()?**\n",
    "    - The `.` character normally matches any character except a newline. If `re.DOTALL` is passed, it matches any character including newline characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **If numRegex = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '12 drummers, 11 pipers, five rings, 3 hens') return?**\n",
    "    - It will return `'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **What does passing re.VERBOSE as the second argument to re.compile() allow you to do?**\n",
    "    - It allows you to write regex patterns more clearly by ignoring whitespace and allowing comments within the pattern, which helps in documenting complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **How would you write a regex that matches a number with commas for every three digits?**\n",
    "    - You can use the following regex: `r'^\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})*$'`. This matches a number that starts with one to three digits and may be followed by groups of exactly three digits preceded by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **How would you write a regex that matches the full name of someone whose last name is Watanabe?**\n",
    "    - The regex could be: `r'^[A-Z][a-zA-Z]* Watanabe$'`. This matches a capitalized first name followed by \"Watanabe\".\n",
    "\n",
    "22. **How would you write a regex that matches a sentence where the first word is either Alice, Bob, or Carol; the second word is either eats, pets, or throws; the third word is apples, cats, or baseballs; and the sentence ends with a period?**\n",
    "    - The regex could be: `r'^(Alice|Bob|Carol) (eats|pets|throws) (apples|cats|baseballs)\\.$'`. Add the `re.IGNORECASE` flag for case insensitivity. "
